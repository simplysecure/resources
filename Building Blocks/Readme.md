## About

Building Blocks is a set of actionable resources for funders to better support digital infrastructure projects and communities of practice. It provides a practical framework for funders who are interested in supporting digital infrastructure but may not yet know how to approach the topic, or would like to have more guidance in entering this community of practice with a sound funding approach.
