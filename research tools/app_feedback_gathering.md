# Small-group activities to gather user feedback

## How to use this guide
```
This session is designed for smaller groups of 2-4 people
with about 1 hour to give feedback on a mobile or desktop
app. You can use this to test
- whether the description, language, and visuals appeal to
  your audience by showing a (real or made-up) listing in 
  the app store;
- whether your new feature or design works as intended for 
  your audience;
- and whether the goal of your app is clear to your 
  audience.

Feel free to adjust some prompts and activities to your
needs; but be careful to not overload your participants 
with information and activities.

You will need:
- Paper print-outs of descriptions, screens, and prompts
- Colourful pens that can be easily seen on paper
- A quiet room with at least one table for each small group
- One facilitator/note-taker per group

Please adjust the prompts accordingly: 
(your app) → the name of your app
(people in your community) → name of the community you’re
interested in; alternatively "people like you", "the 
people that you work with"
```

## Activities

### Activity 0: Introduction (~1 minute)

Say no more than 1-2 sentences thanking people for being there, explaining that `(your app)` is still in beta so the team is looking for honest and frank feedback, and that they’re eager to hear what `(people in your community)` think. *Should take at very most three minutes. *

### Activity 1: Marking up printouts of the **app store listing** (~20 minutes)

#### Preparation

1. Print out the app store listing (one copy for every 1-3 people who will be participating). Make sure that the text is large enough to read, but there is enough space in the margins for participants to make notes.
2. Print out a paper (one copy for every 1-3 people) with the following prompts on it. 
    * Based on this app listing, **who** do you think this app is for? 
    * Based on this app listing, **what** do you think these people will use the app to do?
    * Please highlight parts of the app listing that are unclear or would make it hard for `(people in your community)` to want to use it.
    * Is any of the language too technical or culturally confusing?
    * Please point out any things that you think the app listing could do differently that would encourage `(people in your community)` to want to use it. 

#### Activity

1. Give participants 5-10 minutes to read the prompts and start responding to them. Tell people that you will be collecting the papers at the end so you can share information with the developers. 
2. Facilitate a group discussion for another 10 minutes.
    * What stood out to you the most in looking at the app store listing? 
    * What are the most important things you’d like the developers to know after reviewing the listing? 
    * Is there anything you didn’t have time to write down? 
    * (Review what they wrote to make sure you understand it all.)

### Activity 2: Marking up drafts of the new designs (~20 minutes)

#### Preparation

1. Print out the new screens (one copy for every 1-3 people). Make sure that the text is large enough to read, but there is enough space in the margins for participants to make notes. 
2. Print out a paper (one copy for every 1-3 people) with the following prompts on it. Tell people that you will be collecting the papers at the end so you can share information with the developers. 
    * **What** do you think this does?
    * What would you **hope** that this does?
    * Does this application seem like it would provide you or `(people in your community)` value or improve `(your x/experience with x)`?
    * If not for you or `(people in your community)`, for whom do you think this would be most valuable?

#### Activity

1. Give participants 5-10 minutes to read the prompts and start responding to them
2. Facilitate a group discussion for another 10 minutes
    * What **problems** would this solve?
    * Does it raise any **concerns or issues** for you?
    * What are the most important things you’d like the developers to know after reviewing the new design? 
    * Is there anything you didn’t have time to write down? 
    * (Review what they wrote to make sure you understand it all.)

### Activity 3: Check in on the goals of **`(your app)`** (~10 minutes)

#### Activity

1. After collecting the papers, start an informal discussion. Ask users: 
    * Now that you’ve seen some of what the app looks like, how has your understanding of what `(your app)` does changed? 
    * What do you think people use the app to do? 
    * Do you think it will be useful for `(people in your community)`?

2. Take notes from the discussion on paper.


As you wrap up, make sure to thank your participants for their time, and offer them a channel for additional thoughts and comments.
